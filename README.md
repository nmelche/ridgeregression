Ridge Regression using mini-batch Gradien Descent

This code is part of my homework for a machine learning lab at the University of Hildesheim.
We had to implement Ride Regression using mini-Batch Gradient Descent with a grid search and k-fold cross validation in order to train our model for a regression dataset.
